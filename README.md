* readme.md; Should include Github member ID's and names, and a link to Youtube video that will I will publish describing my application (see instructional pdf for more details)
* A zipped file for your source code (e.g., VS solution) folder. Note that please delete large-size folders
such as bin/temp/debug. The zip file should be less than 20 MB.

## Description
The goal is to create an application that utilizes databases in the background with a GUI to control and make user input better. Doesn't need to be fancy, it's a 2 (or 3) week project so let's keep it barebones, focus more on the db than the GUI.
